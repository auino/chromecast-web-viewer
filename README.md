# chromecast-web-viewer

This project allows you to easily set up a web page to show web videos.
(Google Chromecast)[https://www.google.com/chromecast] support is implemented: if Chromecast is supported, the user has got the ability to cast the video on his device.
Otherwise, a simple video is shown.

This project represents an extension of the [CastVideos-chrome](https://github.com/googlecast/CastVideos-chrome) project.
For further details, please refer to the original project.
